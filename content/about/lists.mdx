# Sharing recommendations with like minded people is the best

sli.st is a reference to S tier lists.

I've found that the DJs I like tend to share similar interests as me. Dark techno DJs seem to like dark sci-fi for example. I imagine the reverse is also true- people who share similar interests in other artwork genres are likely to also share similar musical tastes.

Sharing my tastes in stuff like mangas and contemporary art might help me expose my tastes in music to new people who have yet to hear my work.
