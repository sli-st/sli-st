title: "DJ Name"

Sometime in September I saw a post from "El Real Under" about their open deck
events on Thursdays. I sent them a DM with a description of what I
liked to play and they invited me over and asked for my DJ name.

Somehow I had never decided on a name before that point despite
practicing for many hours on end. I figured "S List" already had
some branding behind it, that some of my closest friends knew
that I was behind the project, and that it was easy enough to
pronounce. So I went with "S List" for my first ever flyer. Towards
the end of September, I was invited to open for 49 Basan's B Space project.

It was my first official non-open-deck gig (they put my face on a
flyer official). When they asked for my DJ name I almost started coming up with new names. This was a few weeks within the launch of the website. I wanted to adopt the "." in the domain name in all S List branding, including my DJ name.

I figured if anyone ever googles my name they will at the very least find the website even if my social media goes down.
Yes, I had/have severe PTS from my accounts getting taken down.

The SLi.ST spelling comes from the domain name itself- "sli.st". The capitalization choices come from the "symmetry" between the "i" and period.

          NYC born and raised. Arrived in CDMX June 7, '21. Started the SLi.ST
          flyer sharing project mid-July. A common face on the hard techno
          dancefloors, many ravers know him as S----. However, many more know
          him as the relatively anonymous SLi.ST due to his overly personal rave
          stories and bizarre history of community (re)building.

            March 2021: discovered the Colombian influenced dark techno scene in
            NYC and fell in love.

            July: came to CDMX on a one-way to see if I could find a similar
            scene with plans to go explore more of Mexico after a couple weeks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Discovered a much darker, filthier, and more experimental techno
            scene in CDMX. Fell in love and abandoned all other plans.

            Started the SLi.ST flyer sharing project anonymously in July.
            Started going to a lot of events and meeting more people (especially
            a lot of DJs whose music tastes I liked).

          <li>
            Had a quarter-life crisis and realized I loved the music scene and
            that I also needed to share my personal tastes with the people
            around me so that I could be happy with myself and find inner peace.
          </li>
          <li>
            Started watcing youtube videos on DJing, downloaded some music, and
            basically started telling everyone around me that I was trying to
            become a DJ. Asked friends if I could play b2b with them in order to
            learn from them. (Very casual but very informative).

            Got my first couple gigs in September and Octobber at "The Real
            Under" and "49 Basan". Organizers liked my taste in dark melodic
            house/techno.

            January 1st, saw a flyer for a 7am afterparty at NIX. A DJ friend
            asked if I had my USB and if I'd like to play later. I said yes. Got
            to play for a bunch of people who gave me some of the most
            encouraging words ever about my skills and taste in progressive
            house and dark industrial techno. Big confidence boost so I wrote up
            my very first EPK (Jan 3rd).
