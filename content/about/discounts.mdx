title: "Discounts"

This is my first attempt at promoting events commercially. In exchange for not taking a cut from ticket sales I want the exclusive right to the biggest discounts. If someone from my base sees a discount posted on this website, I do not want them to look around for a better offer. I want to be their last stop before making a purchase. Anything short of that hurts my credibility.

## Why?

I need to give people more reasons to continue following me. Most people seem to enjoy and trust my curating so this is building on that.

## Goals:

- offer bigger discounts than anyone else
- become the point of authority for cheaper tickets to the best raves
