This was their first water event and the lineup wasn't their typical choices for techno. Solid upper level lineup with one of the chillest b2b duos I've seen and met so far. But too chill for my music tastes at the moment. I stayed mostly in the lower level except to get some air with my techno friend. Downstairs was sweaty af. The dancefloor was crowded. The typical techno crowd wasn't there and there were plenty of people who were just there because boat party!!! A bunch of friends were there in the vip section. I'm not sure if I was invited but I chilled there for a bit, hugs and kisses, no one cared so whatever. Dancefloor was more fun so I ended up back there every now and then. Rest of the crowd were weird. Not really there for music. Mostly pictures. And more creepers than usual who probably like to get off on violating personal spaces. If I were a bouncer, half the people wouldn't have been at that party.This event needed better screening. Music was okay. Rocking of the boat with some techno was cool. I ran into Vendex again and he said he was going to play a special surpise set in the end, buttt then the event ended earlier than expected and apparently there was some incompatibility between his equipment and the stuff on the boat. I went to this event because it was the first Taken event on water. They are an amazing collective when it comes to dark techno, they have a loyal following of mostly decent ravers, and they are passionate about sharing their love of dark techno with the NYC underground scene. The typical underground scene wasn't there that night. Many types of people you would never see at any of their other techno events - but I suppose this may have been more about the boat than techno. I should have done better research. Upstairs was pretty cool. Got to feel like a tourist as the boat went around the Statue of Liberty. Just about every single Taken flyer I've seen since I came to CDMX has made me think about going back just to remove the bad taste that I left with with my last Taken party. Looking forward to replace this memory with another Taken event when I eventually go back to the NYC underground.
