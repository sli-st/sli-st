DJ Sound Pilot from NY/NJ texted me while I was in CDMX about Hector Oaks. Big recommendation. I was at another party and I wasn't having a ton of fun. I think I got there too early maybe. There was some regaetton upstairs. Some dude bumped into me and started talking to me. I didn't want to be social, or rude, so I decided to talk, give short answers, see how interested another person could really be in a one-side conversation. Typical psychopath/sociopath behavior. Idk diagnose me. Ayo. Anyways he starts telling me about these other parties. I might have asked him how he was finding parties. So he shows me this flyer and I remembered that my friend had recommended I check him out. Flyer was red and black too ayo. Dude tells me has the address. We split an Uber there- there along with another one of his friends. Turns out the party got cancelled at that location?? He calls another one of his friends for the address. And we end up going to Donceles. There were two parties that night. I don't have the second flyer yet. I didn't have the flyer for the party on the 1st floor, but I'm sure I can track it down. I recently confirmed that Lokier was playing downstairs that night. She was playing harder techno than just about anything upstairs. However, I got there later than I wanted to, and the event wasn't about hard techno. As the flyer clearly indicates, it was about Hector Oaks and whatever he wanted to play. I liked his style of throwbacks with non-techno tracks. He played Michael Jackson at some point. I don't really love Michael Jackson's music, I like some parodies by Weird Al if anything. I just thought it was cool and interesting. At the beginning of his set there was some technical issue and the music got cut off. From that point on it seemed like he had lost the crowd's trust. Every time he would go back to look for a track in his crate people seemed to realize that the track was about to change very soon and that we should chill for a minute. At the end of the show I stuck around to see what was going on. Saw Hector, said hi. He asked what I thought of the show and I pretty much told him what I wrote above about losing the audience's trust due to the technical issue. He confirmed that there were some sound issues so it wasn't just in my head. Party was great. Hector Oaks mixed in a nice variety of music. Intro track was a little cheesy, but so was everything so I think he set the mood pretty skillfully. This was at the second floor. Lots of sweat. Not enough fans. Completely crowded to the bar. Good stuff. I raved at the front. Only drunk and maybe high this time. After he finished his set people went to the event downstairs. Cool night. Overall the music wasn't dark techno which is what I was expecting from the flyer and location. However, if I had a better idea of who Hector Oaks I would have had different expectations. I've downloaded some of his music to my library. If I had to say what kind of music he was playing, I'd probably say tech house, but that would be an oversimplification.
