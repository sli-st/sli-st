I liked this event a lot. New location for me so that may have helped, but it was more about the music and the curated atmosphere. I went to this party solo. Guest List Mx on instagram posted a story to raffle off spots for a guest list. Me, as a cheap bastard and poor planner, messaged them after their raffle was over from my slist ig account (with like less than 20% of my original followership jaja). They were like sure, what's your name. I think I gave them a fake name or something. Anyways I get to the door and E.T. was managing at the time and he tells me it's like 200 pesos and I tell him that I was on the list, and he was like "what list?", and I was like guest list jaja. I was shocked when I was told I was not on the list. Luckily there weren't any hot singles nearby/behind me so I didn't have to lose whatever dignity I might've had... So I showed him the DMs from guest list mx, and he calls over Valac. OG Valac saves my ass and tells him it's all good. I saved $150 pesos which I probably would have spent at the bar. So I go in and it's already more than 50 percent full. Large room too, so their marketing was definitely on point for this event. Lately I had been trying to go to parties solo and stay solo. I was nostalgic of feeling like a tourist and idk. I hung around the back, but as with every single hard techno party there was bound to be people I'd know. A few hellos, fist bumps, and hugs later I changed location and went to the other back of the party near the bar. From there I spotted the most regular faces of the CDMX hard techno scene who I should probably not name since they sold me some really duro good acid. I bought two tabs and took both of them at once (as per usual). I think I took them later, maybe 30 mins before Miss Crafty's set. So at this point I'm at the front right just chilling and Miss Crafty walks by. She doesn't know me because I'm no one, but I've seen her at a couple shows and like a retard I ask her what she was going to play. I figured acid or industrial- not even sure why I asked. She replied "good techno". I was like ok cool (but like in my head I think... actually I was in my head for most of that event- the acid was really good). She played good techno. Like some of the goodest, nastiest, filthiest, puroduro techno I've heard this year. It might have been the acid, but I was also taking a lot of drugs those days so I'm pretty confident my recollection is accurate. I went to the next Trasfondo party as well when they had a similar lineup just because she was going to play again. Unfortunately the next event wasn't as good for me. Different music, different vibe. --- But back to this event! So Crafty starts playing and I look over to my friend and we just nod with eyes wide open. We knew this was going to be some dark dark good techno. She didn't even wait. Not much of a transition from the previous DJs. Just raw. Ayo. Previous DJs did a great job keeping everyone warmed up and ready for the last two sets. It was hard industrial acid techno plus whatever else good techno. It was so intense that at some point I left the party to get some air and an electrolite from the local gas station. Unfortunately, when I came back Miss Crafty's set was over and Anduaga and Elliot Milan started playing. I'm curious how she ended her set. The energy had definitely dropped so maybe it was a good call to step out, take a breather, and come back with my ears recharged. I didn't have to deal with coming down from such intense music, although I'm sure they carefully brought the energy down just fine. Next set was different. Maybe lower bpm, and maybe maybe more lower energy points throughout the set, but perfectly done. The music was more psychedelic. Still acid, maybe more, but I think less industrial. So here's where my high recollection come in. At some point I just needed some space and I start smelling this odor in the air. Kind of like perfume. Maybe actually perfume. Or ORRR pheromones. This is highly conspiracy thinking, but I think there might have been something in the air. Maybe actually perfume or something. I don't know. I was high. It seemed like the party got 3 times more intense from that single moment, however. My sense of time was skewed so maybe a bit later. Music was booming hard. I could feel every rhythm and beat and I felt totally in sync. At some point I felt like I was dancing with the music as if the music was being played to my movements. I was on acid. The music felt intimately psychedelic. I felt controlled by the music. I'm not sure how they created that atmosphere. Music was sexual af. People were apparently fucking in the party. Like not even in the restrooms, just out in the open. There were some filthy fucks that night. Not as filthy as the music of course. On the topic of filth. Quintos was hosting that night. He wore this fantastic blue alien type costume and he seemed to really add to the atmosphere. I'm not too fond of host/ess/es but his performance was next level. If anything I like abstract costumes better than outright sexual ones. Makes me feel less of a creep. I mean I like strip clubs and I've enjoyed many a ton of EDM parties in Bangkok, and having strippers all around the main stage is cool, but I think it might take away from the spirit of techno. The music should be able to stand by itself. I'll talk about my techno philosophies in another post- minor tangent. Anyways, Quintos was great. Music was great. I didn't buy a single drink since I just bought some water outside. They were cool enough to let me bring in the bottle. In fact I don't think I spent a single peso there. Not because I'm a cheap bastard as mentioned earlier - I just happened to get some water at the same time I needed a breather and they let me bring it in. Lol. Not much else to say, I stayed till the end and spent like 2 hours on the stairs after the party ended just listening to music, smoking, and coming down from my high. I don't think I went to an after that day. The other sets were good but I don't remember who was playing. It was chill, they nurtured the crowd perfectly until the last 3 DJ's, mentioned above, played. Hard techno trasfondo nights are rare. They draw dedicated techno crowds. Always familiar faces because they know what to expect. No lasers. Good music. Not sure what else I forgot. Flyer looked like cheesiest thing ever. I didn't even realize it said Trasfondo for awhile. In retrospect the flyer was as bizarre as the event itself. I felt like I got too high to enjoy the event to its fullest. For the next week+ I actually went to every single event completely sober because I didn't want to feel like I wasn't there. I felt like I was in my head with just the music far too many times that night. It was a learning experience and tried to chase the rush I got from that event many times since that night. It was very hard to top. Nasty.
