This was in my first week in CDMX. I had no leads for underground parties, but I somehow found this event on IG by searching for fiesta tags. I had to send a message via whatsapp for a party for the first time in my life. Luckily they responded and sent the address without any questions. Buen af. I got an uber to the address, saw some people near the dropoff but I could only hear non-electronic music. I started looking through my phone to double check and the dudes were like what's up? what are you looking for? there's a party upstairs. And I actually got a little sketched out and walked across the street to look at my phone in peace. At some point I just said fuck it and went back to them with my broken spanish. yo buscando para un fiesta de electronic music y este es la flyer pero no se, but probably in a much more stupid way. They started laughing and were like it's here but a couple floor above. If I remember correctly, they also gave me discount! When I was looking through my phone earlier, they told me a price which was lower than what I saw on instagram which made me think I was in the wrong place. In NY almost every underground party would send out an address that was just a bit away from the real address, I figured that might have been the case here too. Anyways, they charged me the same price even though it took me awhile to realize I was at the right place and even though I was being a stupid tourist. Throughout the night as I took breaks from the dancefloor I would have small conversations with them about the music, my trip, my plans, and my experience with music. At some point they asked me if I liked drugs, and I said I like acid. This one dude emptied his pockets with all the drugs he was carrying and asked me if I wanted anything. He seemed to have everything besides acid however. That happened throughout the night. After seeing the flyer, someone led me up a few flights of stairs to the techno floor. On my way up there was a group of people dressed in pretty flashy clothes. Probabbly twice my age. I was wearing a really loud floral green jacket and they were like coooool and wanted to take pictures. Normally I'd probably be weirded out and bbe like no thanks, but I liked their energy. Anyways, ticket person charges me a couple hundred pesos, puts a wristband on me and I go inside. Inside I see two areas. One on the left where the DJ was, tables along the walls, and a rope blocking the entrance. On the right was the bar, a smaller dancefloor and a speaker in the corner playing the same music. Naturally, I went for the area on the left for the main dancefloor. I was quickly stopped by the rope dude, who was like do you have a ticket and I pointed to my wristband and then he started explaining something in Spanish and I was like no hablo lo siento. Then someone else came over to explain in english that the room was a VIP room and that the entry fee was two bottles. I was like "solo un person, no necesito dos bottles, pero yo lo pienso" and then I went to the bar and ordered a basic drink, probably rum and coke or vodka and juice,... or maybe it was just water. A couple minutes later this woman comes up to me and tells me in english that if I continue to buy drinks I can go to the vip section. No fucking se, pero bien lmao. I like to think it was because of the humourous situation outside, my cool jacket, and my beard which made me stand out and seem interesting. I don't know, but I went inside, saw the same people who wanted to take a picture with me before - they wanted another with their other friends- I was like whatever at that point. The music was okay, you could smoke inside, but it seemed a little boring to me. I spent my time going to both dancefloors throughout the night as I got drinks. I danced for awhile as well, and at some point they started moving the tables away and put in a couch. Around this time I started getting bored of the down tempo music and decided to sit down. I was in the vip section, but I didn't get a table loool (since I wasn't going to buy two bottles). Anyways, I started nodding off as I was waiting for the music or DJ to change. Everytime I caught myself falling asleep I would just nod my head to the beat to make it seem like I was still there and enjoying the music. First rave in CDMX. On a Thursday. And I was falling asleep because the music was kind of uninteresting for me. One of the sets was definitely good however, I just don't know who it was. My first impression of the music was "meh more house", but I was impressed by how friendly and welcoming everyone was to some random tourist. Overall a good impression. I don't like parties with VIP areas. I think it makes people on both sides of the rope uncomfortale with the dynamic that is being perpetuated. I also hate tables on the dancefloor. It's tacky and takes away from the purpose of going to a music event where people are expected to dance. It's not techno. The event was promoted as an all female lineup event. They were all women. Cool. I suppose that's a draw for some people. If it's not about their music selection, then it's just about their bodies??? Cool? I didn't like most of the music I heard, but they were hot sooo....... maybe the music wasn't much of a priority for this event??? Anyways, good vibes, decent first impression of Mexican hospitality.
