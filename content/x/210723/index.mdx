This was when I was most active on the original IG account, @slistcdmx. I saw the flyer which had a few more names such as Rafiko and Yambs b2b. I messaged Rafiko if we could put like 5 people on the list. I gave a fake name. Showed up with some acquaintances (at the time) that I would never hang out with again. Not the type of people I like to associate with. We actually went to the door right next to the party we were meaning to go to. The place we first entered didn't seem right. It was some sort of a bar, but the music was not electronic. Somehow the clowns I came with stayed at that party. I went to the techno party and told them that their names were on the list and then I forgot about them and just enjoyed the melodic techno that was being played. It was a bit house-y for my liking, but Rafiko and Yambs tend to play music I don't hear often, and they have good taste so I was having a pretty decent time. At some point I was bored and I went to sit down on some chairs away from the music and put on some headphones. I didn't feel like socializing, but I was a bit hungry. And so I ordered some UberEats. Got some sort of a burger or something and when I went to get it from the delivery dude the pinche people at the door were like no re-entry. So then I had to bust out google translate (because my Spanish was much shittier back then) and tell them that it was some misunderstanding, dropped a DJ name once or twice, told them I was under the impression that they weren't dickhead assholes, etc. etc. They let me back in, but I wasn't allowed to take my burger upstairs with me. I ate my burger without any beverage. So I didn't like that aspect of the "rave". Camea played a bit later. I got to see her play for a bit in Brooklyn, so I didn't really have much of an impression besides knowing that I shouldn't expect hard techno. It was cool techno. Dance floor was moderately packed. People were dancing in two separate rooms because there wasn't much space, or maybe just because one room was designated as the cool room. I don't know, but it seemed like a good party by most metrics. The decor was too tropical for me, but I suppose it fit the music. I had more fun just hanging with DJ friends. Nice thing about DJ friends, besides their access to good drug connects, is that they tend to know where the good after parties are. The shitheads I had initially come with eventually had to leave the party next door since it ended earlier. They came to party that I went to, but because of their shittiness I didn't tell them about the after once I found out about it. After party was at sv30. DJ friends squeezed me into someone's car and got me in for free. Totally worth ditching clowns and pretending they don't exist. Overall good time even though it wasn't totally my scene. Camea played a Spektre track in the end which I thought was super cool. I forget which track it was, but I was in a bit of a Spektre phase at the time. I had to ask her to verify. Also had to mention that I saw her play a couple months ago. Cool humble person who played some "dark" melodic techno in the end - one of my favorite genres. I don't remember much, but I do remember dancing and not falling asleep. I enjoyed my time there. Only thing I'd change would be to go there by myself instead of with some clowns.
