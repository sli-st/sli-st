This one is a bit weird and I'm not sure if I should even share this one. The event did not go as planned, but there are some funny bits and thoughts that might be worth sharing? (I'm sure someone will let me know). Anders Bart is one of my favorite DJs in CDMX. I don't think I've seen anyone mix psy techno/trance like him. His sets sound fresh and new. So when I saw his name listed amongst like 30 other DJs that I've never heard of, I was like yep, this is the party I'm going to. So in the midst of hype I started sharing this flyer along with several stories of his sets from before. A couple days before I messaged him about his set time, and an almost sarcastic question about whether or not he'd be playing dark techno. Obvio. He mentioned he had an extra ticket and actually invited me to meet up with him and his Daniella (frequent raver) before going. I'm very glad he did because when I was looking up the directions the night before, I was like damn what did I get myself into. It was relatively far outside of the city. Cool trip there. Cool music on the way of course jaja. I actually passed out for a bit. 15 mins before we arrive Anders tells me that if I have any drugs I should hide them as well as possible. I had a couple pills of MDMA. I probably should have just taken the drugs right before going in, but I wanted to time my high for the dark techno sets or his set specifically. I was told the rest of the sets would be more tech house with some techno here and there. They had the shadiest and grimiest security ever for this show. They confiscated my pack with 2 cigarettes. They wouldn't even let me smoke it at the entrance. It was obviously so that they could sell people cigarettes later. That's just straight up foul. They were selling cigarettes for 10 pesos each inside. That's a ~4x markup. Absolutely foul. And completely the opposite of taking care of your guests. So back to hiding my drugs. Anders suggested I hide them in my boxers or like up my ass. He wasn't joking. They were very thorough... I hid them in my socks which they patted down. When I got in I was still spooked by the security. There were like at least 10 shady motherfuckers just walking round. So, like an idiot I walked to the back near the trees to pretend I was going for a piss so I could dig in my socks. 5 seconds of me standing still and these MFers start shining their lights in my direction. On the way to the trees I had changed my plan to first actually taking a piss, and then stopping to tie my shoes to get the pills out. Again, it must be noted that I was being an idiot. I could've just asked for where the portable restrooms were. So I take a piss under pressure and on my way back I stopped to tie my shoes and this one MFer points a light directly at me. And he probably asked me what I was doing. And I was like nada was hombre and like hay un bano- even though I just took a piss (I was too nervous to dig in my sock for some pills). If I got kicked out, I wasn't even sure if an Uber would find me all the way out wherever I was. We were in some clearing between a farm and a forest somewhere pretty far up with very little stuff going around. No OXXOs nearby. So on my way to the bathrooms I bought a pack of cigarettes from the MFers for 200 pesos which is why I'm constantly referring to them as MFers. Aside from their fucked policies, they were pretty chill people. One of them brought their scary looking police dog who was fun to play with every now and then while I was high. After a much needed smoke, I went away from the main stage where most people were, dug my drugs out of my sock, and took one within the next hour. (They were in a baggie- it's 2021 we hygienic now :). I asked one of the organizers for the set times so I could plan my high. I was under the impression that Anders was going to play soon and the music at the time was chill. There were two stages. One large area with fenced off VIP seating and tables, and one for the unwashed masses. Very anti techno imo. It was raining that night. There was a tent tarp above us and nothing else for the wind. The dj booth was high up as if this was some EDM festival. Maybe it would have looked better or more appropriate if there were more people, but there wasn't. That was probably due to the rain rather than anything else. I think there were 150 people at most including staff and security. They advertised the event months in advance but were slowly releasing the lineup. Must have been the weather. The smaller stage had smaller speakers and was barely a stage as it could only fit 30 people max at best. I personally don't care about the size of the dance floor as long as the music is good. I've partied in a room by myself and a DJ multiple times. Some of those experiences beat many of the full on rave experiences. Music always comes first. Unfortunately, the DJ who was playing at the smaller stage blew out the speakers. Shit happens. People were actually still chilling there in case things could be repaired instead of going back to the main stage. Main stage was still too chill at this point. The smaller stage got cancelled. They didn't have any replacement speakers and didn't want to get some more from the city which was an hour away?? for an event that was going to go on for like 12 more hours?? With like 30 different pjs?? Of whom they'd have to cancel half???? No se wey. So there I was in some strange cold festival type event. Just waiting for the MDMA to kick in with nothing much to look forward to in terms of music. Luckily the MDMA kept me warm because my rain jacket kind of got wet on the inside from the rain and sweat. The nice thing was that I wasn't there alone. MDMA kicked in, music got better, I got warmer, and I danced with just a short sleeve (wool) shirt on for the next few hours. It was tech house for the most part, and each set seemed to only last an hour. I don't think an hour is enough most of the time, but I liked being able to experience a wide variety of dj styles. One DJ got mad that the crowd wasn't as hyped as she wanted us to be with the cold weather and shitty hospitality. Food was minimal. If they hired a taco dude, they would've made bank lmao. Anyways, I don't know who the DJ was, and I don't want to really find out, but they were doing these awful effects and motioning at people to get up and move. Like damn b, play some better music if you want people to move. It's nothing personal, we can barely even see you from this far down. Chill with that screeching effect b. My two friends and I did not like her style of mixing. Her antics actually made more people stop dancing. We could hear her frustration in her mixing. So I suppose her communication skills were above average- she just had nothing worth communicating jaja. Matt Sassari played later. I had no expectations since I did not research. I just heard that he was more of a tech  house DJ. I liked his set even though I wasn't the biggest tech house fan at the time. Nowadays tech house, as a genre, is super vague for me and I can't seriously pretend I hate it. His set and a few others were nice. I was dancing and having a pretty decent time. I enjoyed the Molly. I found a mask on a table boy security at some point and asked if I could borrow it. For some reason in my high state of mind I danced with the mask on and discovered a new fetish... lol... I wasn't hungry until just before we left in the morning. They had these fried tortillas with cheese, chicken, and some salsa. It was minimal, but tasty. Reasonable price as well compared the the cigarettes which I'm still salty about. I met Anders' cousin who I met in my first weekend here in CDMX unbeknownst to both of us. The raver world is very small. Ride back was chill. Finally got to hear Anders' taste in music again after awhile. Got some breakfast pastries with them. Cool morning. MDMA comedown was decent. I heard decent music. Got to get near some nature. Saw stars in the sky that night. Morning fog was beautiful, but wasted. I might actually go again. They event was supposed to be much better, but the weather got in the way and one of the stages got cancelled. It was disappointing, but not a waste of time or weekend.
