Sonico is a real supporter of the underground. Dude traveled from Colombia just to play in some house basement in Brooklyn. But to be fair this was the real basement bbasement that was just known as the basement for many ravers- the safe haven of ravers from the virus- because the lack of ventilation and smoke in the air probably killed any virus or biological anything in the air. It was a party by Taken NYC. Dude played for like more than 6 hours. I got there at 10pmish and left at like 10am. Some events in this location were shutdown by the police before, but somehow this weekend event just kept going. Drinks were fine. You could sneak stuff in. Drugs were around. No disco balls. It was still going on until atleast noon. It got packed. He played really good high bpm industrial techno. More hard than acid if anything. At some point Sonico went to the restroom and just left a track playing. People were still dancing as if he were still right there. ike "damn dude your music is so good you don't even need to be here." And he was like "word". Set design was techno- simple and minimal with a cage in front of the DJ booth to protect the equipment from attention-starved idiots like me who need to be in the front near the speakers. We had a nice cameo appearance from local techno DJ Mike Lee- Like Mee (dj handle at the time) who was playing in some non-techno venue in New Jersey. I was living in New Jersey at the time, but partying with people from NJ is probably miserable so I went to NYC instead (very close and convenient). But he showed up anyways later in the night and played b2b. Both super humble people, good taste in music, and both were ready again for the outdoor party the following evening. Sonico peeps and friends wanted to take cool pictures and videos at a park between two bridges. It was cold, and I was hungry, but I ordered some Wendy's with Uber, had a few smokes, chilled with central figures of the NYC underground (didn't know at the time). Asked Sonico about his type of music because too many electronic subcategories. We exchanged names, he told me to add him on IG. He didn't add me back. Hard techno.
