homepage: Another big update. I've decided to go back to an older design philosophy regarding the homepage. It's now specifically for looking at flyers for upcoming events. It's the only page out of the 5 main pages to have the "date navigation bar" and it's the first page visitors see when typing in sli.st. One of the original purposes of this project was to help visitors find upcoming parties so I think that should be reflected in thhe homepage. The first instagram account (@slistcdmx) I made for this project sorted all the events by date in stories (for the next 3 weeks), this site sorts flyers for the next 2 months!. There were also highlights for events outside of CDMX, and also a highlighht titled "S LIST" for events on my personal list for checking out. I've decided to bring that back for the homepage. I had a similiar version of this feature a few weeks ago (you could scroll horizontally for my event recommendations). I decided to remove it because it seemed a bit too commercial. This iteration is not for recommendations (directly)- instead it's just to let people know which parties I'll be going to since a bunch of people know that I'm always looking for the best (subjective but pretty objective tbh) dark techno, experimental, and interesting events. I have a reputation to maintain! In the near future I will be including specific reasons as to why I will be looking forward to each event. I might also include sponsored flyers (with special markings) in the future. I have also made the date navigation bar vertically wider and increased the size of the numbers for better clickability.

I removed the text links from the body of the homepage because I expect users to land on the website, find some flyers, feel good, and then click around out of curiosity. When they land on any of the other pages I want them to be hooked by the consistent minimalist design and keep exploring. Main goal right now is to get people to sign up for membership perks. Perks are coming in and I'm 99% certain people are taking note. I believe we will soon have the same number of discounts and cortesias sent to us as when the original instagram account was active (expect a full page of them). The perks will probably be better than just raffles however as I will not be allowing those kinds of perks on the website, but most likely through the instagram as it's still better for giveaways.

Just about every link on the website appears only once. I don't know if that is the wisest decision, but I think the lack of redundancy fits the design of the site, the project, and the message. Every page is supposed to have a singular purpose. But maybe the singular singular purpose should be user sign ups? And maybe I'm sacrificing that for aesthetics???

Will experiment.

S page: This is just a page of links to information abbout the project, and in the future, as a way for me to better interact with the community. Sounds very arrogant because who would want to interact with me (lool), but this is an experiment and I will be trying different ways to bring engagement so a bit of hope is required here haha. It will include things such as updates about the website, like this post, links to commmunity playlists so that we can all exchange some good music, link(s) to social media, links to special supporters of this project (long overdue), recorded sets (because more than enough important people have asked me), visual media of myself because I'm not as anonymous anymore (relatively). On that same vein, I want to include pictures of the community on the instagram account as a future experimment. It might help build more engagement (I sound like a sociopath lol), but it might also take away from the flyer sharing aspect.

So far none of the experiments have completely failed. Momentum is borderline decent. And community support is at an all time high - I just haven't been able to take full advantage yet because I'm sort of procrastinating. I could ask everyone who knows me and about this project to help me share this, but I want to wait until this site is out of the structure phase. I think I'll be satisfied with the superficial aspects of this website's design in a couple more weeks. The speed should be optimized in a few days after that and the SEO should be decent as well. When I'm confident that friends will be proud to share this project, I will start asking them to. Maybe all I need is a week - the coding is getting a lot faster as I'm becoming more familiar with the documentation.

I've been advised to save these update posts. It's a bit for me as I love looking back at my thought processes, but my roommate said that he found it a bit interesting and that I should try to make use of whatever content I have because some people (like him) might just find it interesting. Anyways, if anyone wants to know what's going on with the project and where it's going, they'll find it here.

I might be going back to edit previous posts. The writing style may not translate well. Or maybe I'll just pump out as much content as possible, put an "unedited" sign, and just keep going. Maybe keeping it english is fine. 40 percent of users are browsing in Spanish according to google analytics so maybe I don't really have a choice.

Current goals:
- make the flyers on the homepage clickable to display my reasons for going
- remove some features from the zoomed in flyer view to reduce bugs, friction, and improve speed
- automate the updating of the members list
- explore dark/day mode options
- explore language switching options
- a few more reflections - maybe I will let people on IG decide which to write about? - maybe not many people care? I know a few who do so I don't know. 
- a multilingual about page
