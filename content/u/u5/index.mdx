title: "Huge Redesign. Removed Flyer Section. Flyers now on Instagram only. More content."

Homepage: The homepage has been completely redesigned from scratch. All the major pages are linked from the homepage. My goal with the homepage is to get people to click around. There isn't a single traditional call to action button, but rather multiple. I want visitors to explore so I made the homepage a bit more fun with visuals and clickable squares instead of text-links. There are very few labels for the buttons, because the intention is to get the visitor curious.

There is a banner link at the top which I intend to change every now and then to direct visitors to what I think is currently important. Right now it's the instagram page. I want visitors to the site to check out the instagram and all the other links, and I want Instagram visitors to my profile to check out the website link in the bio.

Just about everything on the website that doesn't look like simple text is clickable. There are multiple small squares on the homepage for the different subprojects of SLi.ST. And there is one large square for info/flyers I want to spotlight.

New projects: I am now sharing my recorded DJ mix on the website. For a while I was against it because I thought it was inapropriate for the overall project. However, as I started working on the other projects and as this webbsite became more than just sharing new flyers, I started adding more personalized content.

I was showing the website to a friend and he asked me where the link to my mixes were. When I said I wasn't planning on sharing them here, he encouraged me share them instead. I will continue to consider where I should share it. Maybe a subb page instead of a main page.

The about page is split into multiple about pages. And each of the main pages have their corresponding abbout pages linked from them.

There is a new rave tips page for generating more page views from google.

There is now a page for downloading "flyers" for this project.

Current goals:

- 2 reflection posts a week
- 20 additional rave tips a week
- share more content on instagram to show up on more feeds
- consider light and dark theme
