title: "New navigation and homepage. New reflection posts. Less redundancy. Fewer main navigation items."

Homepage: The entire website should now be more intuitive. At least a couple visitors did not realize that the numbers at the top of the website referred to dates. A couple also did not know about the reflections page - still does not have an actual name yet. Current hypothesis is that there were too many navigation links and that they may have been overwhelming. The 5 main links at the bottom of every screen were unlabeled due to aesthetic reasons. I still like the idea of a minimalist navigation bar so I'm continuing to leave them unlabeled. However, in order to make it easier for visitors to explore, I've reduced the number of main navigation links to just 3. The 3 main areas of the website right now are the flyers, reflections, and the members list. They are all accessible from the homepage.

In order to make it more clear that the numbers at top are navigation links, I've put in a neon banner which points up, and also states when the website has been updated with new flyers. 

In order to help spread awareness of this project, I've made some sharable images. They are also displayed on the homepage. Hopefully people will download them, tag me, and post them on social media. This should also make it easier for people if they are looking for these images.

Many of the S links from the old S page have been moved to the homepage. There should be 3 displayed above the fold. I think the about page is most important. I am keeping personal links further below for now as the main focus of the project is to share flyers and to spread awareness of the project itself.

The release notes page may be consolidated under the about section, but I need to find out if people like reading this stuff. This probably isn't the most entertaining content. 

Sharing a link to my social media was one of the primary reasons for starting this website. I'm curious to see if this results in a spike in followers.

There will be a link to my recorded mixes, but I'm trying to figure out a way to make it a more community oriented feature. Maybe favorite mixes. Or maybe I'll host the HQ versions of mixes I find and like. Maybe a spotlight thing. Or maybe I'll just keep it as a personal feature.

There are two redundant links to the reflections page and the members page (as a sign up link). They are at the very bottom and I'm not sure whether to include them or not. I kind of like the idea of every page having only one link to it. Seems minimal, but maybe also extreme.

Reflections: The reflections may later be called experiences. Or X for short. A ecstasy joke. I will babe linking to these posts soon and I needed a shorter url. Instead of "adventures" in the url for the posts, they will now be "x". URLs should be prettier, and it should make it seem more interesting as well (in a techno way). The members page is likewise abbreviated as "m" instead of "members" in URLs. Another rave word play. 

I've recently written 10+ new reflections, with many more on the way. 


Current goals:
- explore flyers on the homepage again
- automate the updating of the members list
- explore dark/day mode options
- explore language switching options
- multilingual about page
