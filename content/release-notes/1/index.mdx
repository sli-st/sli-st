OCT 23 6:50AM: Finally made the flyers clickale for zoomed in views. People are signing up for future perks. The S page is the only large section that needs major work.

I'm not sure if I should bring back the recommendations section. I've been limitting my partying time recently which has made me I'm pickier than ever --- so maybe --- I'll take a survey once the IG page gets a bit bigger.

I need to automate the members list. Right now I'm just copying and pasting the usernames that are signing up - it's tedious and untimely.

Made the perks page a little funnier. I need to work on the copy and translations so visitors can better understand why they would want to sign up. Also need some perks for this upcoming weekend.

The home page has the signup form but it's not very intuitive so maybe I need better content. Or maybe I'll just go back to sharing the events I'm looking forward to.

I also need to write some Speed Pieces for previous events. Should be fun. Also need to find a way to make them easier to share.

I've mostly settled on the icons and colors I will be using. Keeping it red for eye strain, night use, and techno vibes.

I need to come up with a design for the S page where you're reading this. Someone suggested I keep writing and saving my thoughts as blog posts. Not sure. Happy Saturday!
