This was when I started finding events on my own and partying with the Massiosare hostel peeps. Flyer looked dark. Red and dark background amirite? Trasfondo was specifically recommended to me so I suppose that was the reason I thought it would be good. Hostel peeps Ubered to the party where Pura Vida Lab is doing parties every week now. The rooftop with the tent. Anyways, got there and started looking for drugs. I should've messaged to ask if we could get a discount since we were coming as 10+ people. My first priority was to get some drugs. I, as a newly seasoned CDMX raver, went straight to the back of the "room" right past the bar. I saw a bong. They were selling weed out in the open. Maybe my first time seeing weed at a party. Stores in parties. New. So I bought a joint and asked if they had acid. They did. And then I did 3 tabs all at once. Also took a pic of course. They took a pic first of course. This was my first time trying acid in Mexico, but I don't like taking acid feeling the effects and then taking more. I like when it all hits me at once. Anyways acid was great. Trip was intense. This was the first time listening to Miss Crafty mix. The acid was maybe too much. At some point that I thought the the bpm was so high that my heart might skip a beat. I don't remember the music too much. I'm sure it was good since I stayed through the event even though I was having what some might consider a bad trip. Aside from the music the people were chill. I like seeing people I know on the dance floor, I usually prefer going to parties solo. I usually like to feel like a stranger. I don't know, but anyways my hostel mates loved the trip. Thought it was amazing. Danced for hours. Sweat like hell and started drinking tap water. They had fun and kept staying.The weed guys were mad cool. They gave me free weed throughout the event. The one nice thing about going to an event with a lot of people you sort of know is that you can rest assured knowing that if you're having an awful trip, you can just chill near your friends without dancing too hard and just focus on surviving. Personally I like to have bad trips by myself. But again I stayed, so the trip couldn't have been too bad. If anything it must've been intensely awesome. I discovered a new addiction. I like the feeling of being on the edge of possibly taking too many drugs. I like the adrenaline. The fear. The survival mode energy to keep dancing/staying alive to stay alive. I like the edge. Either that or no drugs at all. I don't like being in the middle. It's like warm coffee. Hot or iced. Cool event. Icy Hot. I didn't like the location in general due to the acoustics. I like thick walls. Not tent tarps? No research. Dark flyer. Went with 10 hostel peeps. First time with Mexican acid. 3 tabs. Thought I might have a heart attack. Thought I might have a heart attack, but stayed. Had fun.
