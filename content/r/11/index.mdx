This may have been my second time listening to Lyo XS play live. First time I was too high for faces and she may have been wearing a mask. I forget.

Got there earlier a bit early, but there were people already dancing, so not too early. I remember Sadgal playing, so I think I missed Femalien's set. She was playing techno as usual but a bit more watered down than usual as well- just not as hard. Makes some sense due to the time slot, but I was hoping for more given her rep.

I was kind of enjoying the music. I got a drink during her set and a few more throughout the night. My original slistcdmx instagram account had just gotten banned so I wasn't in the best mood. I pretty much sat down and just stayed on my phone during Sadgal's set. Music was good, I caught myself tapping to the beat multiple times. I just had other stuff on my mind.

Later, Lyo XS played. I checked out her music before coming to this event because I think* I saw her play at the last Ufopia event and it was nasty experimental - stuff I've never heard elsewhere before then.

She has a few tracks on Spotify and elsewhere and her music really tickled my heart so I had to check her out live. It was experimental, high bpm, and, most importantly, new. I was definitely on my feet and not thinking about other things. Got another drink at this point too.

Next was Vanderlinden. Awesome style. She played punk techno. Like she was mixing in Linken Park and similar types of music with electronic. I don't think it's fair to even describe it as just some type of techno. Very punk. Cross genre. Lyo and Vanderlinden are total boundary breakers.

I wasn't DJing at the time, but I thought to myself that if I were to ever DJ I would try my absolute best to avoid the constraints of genres. Vanderlinden's quick mixing, mashups, whatever, was, and still is, very inspirational. Linken Park! In CDMX! In a place called Japan CDMX lol. It was litt.

At the end of her set she played b2b with Lyo XS. That was cool too. I had a good time despite other bs.

Bathrooms were clean. Drinks were reasonable and I had a few. And the music took my mind off of other bullshit. Cool lineup. I usually avoid events that are "all girl" or "free entry for girls" because I feel like they are kind of gimmicky and disrespectful to rave culture - like what are you here to sell? The music? The drinks? The girls?

But I made an exception this time and I'm glad I did. It was kind of roomy for a Friday event, but that meant plenty of space for dancing. Fellow ravers seemed more energized than I was due to aforementioned reasons. They were better dancers anyways who were totally taking advantage of the experimental music with their experimental moves.
