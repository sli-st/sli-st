Absolute banger music. Cera Khin's promo bio stated that she "plays whatever the fuck she wants." I fucks with that lmao. This was at Donceles 2nd floor. Common Sense Records produces some of the best events in CDMX. They are passionate about hard techno and inviting interesting talent from as many different places as possible. They don't have too many events every month. Usually just once a month, and they seem to give it their all. Always great sound systems and layouts. The one thing I didn't like too much was that the DJ booth was placed much higher than the dance floor. It didn't really take away from the music at all. Separating the DJ from the crowd like that feels like a pop concert or idol worship. Kind of anti-techno in my opinion. Drinks were fine. I was going to this party no matter what that night. I went to Donceles and stopped by the Mezcaleria first to see what was up and say hi. Saw a friend and his gf(?) there. She was I can get us in for free upstairs. I was like dope, I'll wait until you guys want to go party then. So I waited. They wanted to smoke some weed from the weed shop on the same place and then go in upstairs at a more fashionable(?) time. So we chilled for like 30 or mins. We then go upstairs and I find out that she was "mistaken"(??) and couldn't get me in for free. Seemed a little shady and definitely a waste of time for me, not trusting her with any Cortesia talk or drugs ever again :3. Anyways, paid as usual. Asked around until I found the people behind their instagram account. Asked if they'd like to talk about any potential collaborations in the future. Met some of the people behind Common Sense Records. Exchanged some contact info. Friendly people. Busy people. Got a couple drink tickets when they found out I already paid. Maybe I should have messaged them before coming. I don't know. I was still unsure whether or not to stay anonymous. A couple drink tickets in exchange for all the flyer sharing from the past week. Wasn't expecting anything so that was cool. Back to the event itself. Alejandro Franko played a set before the main set. It was hard, but not too hard- great balance. Definitely got the crowd warmed up for Cera Khin. Someone gave me half a molly. I was at the front left near the speakers. Saw some friends. Brought some weed to smoke from the shop downstairs. They're usually the ones with weed so it felt nice to offer some instead for once. Just as I'm twisting off the end of the joint and lighting it, some random woman says hi and asks if she could get a hit. In my head I was like "this is very rude, I don't think I know them, and if I pass this joint that is meant for me and my friends, straight to her that would be rude and disrespectful to the people I'm dancing with". So it was a hard pass for me. I told her (like an asshole) that she was welcome to smoke, but I'm passing it to my friends first. Sounds like a complete dick move, but, but, it's not about the weed. Just basic drug principles? Maybe I was being an asshole, maybe the weed thing to do is to just share unconditionally. I agree with that philosophy when it involves people I know - even as acquaintances. Usually not random ravers. I hope she got high, because I went back to dancing after passing the joint. Music was pure litt. It actually seemed like she was just playing whatever she wanted but also as if she was carefully planning every track and transition for the crowd. It seemed like Cera was carefully watching every single raver and matching the energy perfectly. I don't think I've ever seen another DJ completely control the audience with a mixer like her. Here's a high recollection that may or may not be accurate: I remember stopping for a cigarette break just as it seemed like there was going to be a drop in the music. As I went to light my cigarette I heard the bass get cut off for a millisecond. And when I looked up to her mixing I think I saw wave a finger as if to say no cigarette break for you. It needs to be mentioned again, that I was super high, and that it could've just been my ego imagining things". At some point in the night someone messaged me where to party. I should've asked or figured out what kind of people they were with and should've just ignored the message or sent them elsewhere. In comes 5 crackheads. 2 of them were relativelyy chill, but not the type of people I'd ever trust with money or drugs. I'll eat a taco with them. Maybe. But I'd never willingly pass a joint to most of them. In my high state of mind I was totally disappointed when I saw them. They kept extending their hands for a handshake or fist bump because that's all what some people care about when they first enter a party. Find some people they know. Say hi. Show association. Aquire clout. I didn't want to be associated with a few of them so in order to protect my precious high, I decided that I was going to party solo from that point on. The people I was actually friends with were cool enough to just me do my own thing away from them. The uncool people kept trying to interact with me. FFS I was visibly ignoring them and they wouldn't get the hint. Totally bad vibes. I didn't let it bother me too much, I found my corner at the very front and just raved till the end except for when I went to get a drink. Unfortunately as soon as I got it, she stopped playing (before I could even enjoy the drink back at my previous rave corner. Kind of glad the set ended that way however. Total fan for life. Next DJ cleared the floor. It was pretty amazing how quickly people went to the party downstairs. I went to this event because of Cera Khin's bio description about playing whatever the fuck she wants to play. I didn't need to check her SoundCloud or anything. I was sold. Final detail: she was wearing a plain white shirt. No visible logos. Totally techno.
