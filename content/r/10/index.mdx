Absolute banger music.

@cerakhin 's promo bio stated that she "plays whatever the fuck she wants."

This was before I had the common sense ðŸ˜‰ to listen to DJ soundclouds before going to an event, but I was already sold when I read the bio description.

Flyer was seductive too.

This was a @commonsenserecords event at @nyx_club88 - my favorite combination so far... by far.

CR produces some of the best techno events in CDMX and NIX is a gritty iconic location that is perfect for dark techno.

They are both passionate about hard techno and inviting interesting sounds from around the world.

Commonsense Records doesn't have too many events - usually just once a month, and they always seem to give it their all- great unobtrusive lights, smart layouts, and special attention to the sound systems. Music above all.

The one thing I didn't like was that the DJ booth was on a high platform. I've seen videos of assholes spilling drinks on mixers so maybe this should be the standard. It's just that I think it feels like idol worship like it's some pop concert. A bit anti-techno imo.

Regardless, Cera Khin's ability to read her crowd and control us like a marionette puppeteer is something that I now compare everyone else against.

She set a new standard for me.

Drinks were fine as usual at Nix. Pro tip, if you tip like 20-50 pesos they'll give you much more alcohol. They use the shot glasses as a baseline only. <$

I saw a friend and his crackhead girlfriend who claimed she could get me in for free but that they weren't going to go up for another hour ðŸš©. I was like dope. They wanted to chill at the weed shop and then go upstairs at a more fashionable(?) time. ðŸš©ðŸš© 30 mins later we went upstairs and I find out that she was "mistaken"(??) and that she couldn't get me in for free.

It was shady as fuck.

I think she got them to give her half the money so she could buy more crack and makeup for her cracked up face. SMD (but DEFINITELY not really).

NGL I'm happy about all the bad things that have happened to her since then.

Every now and then she tries to bump into me at parties. S M D.

Anyways, paid as usual. Asked around until I found the people behind their instagram account. Exchanged some contact info. Friendly people. Busy people.

I got a couple drink tickets when they found out I was behind this flyer sharing project and that I had ended up paying. Really appreciated the gesture. Maybe I should have messaged them before coming but at the time I was still unsure about whether or not to stay anonymous.

Back to the event itself.

Alejandro Franko played a set before the main set. It was hard, but not too hard- great balance. CS events are almost always organized like that - everyone besides the headliner is a supporting act. I have mixed feelings about this but who am I lol. Definitely got the crowd warmed up for Cera Khin.

As I was making my way to the front, someone poked me and was like I saw you at (insert event) a while back. Hereâ€™s half a molly. I later gave him one of my drink tickets so he wouldnâ€™t get the wrong idea -.-. Apparently offering drugs to people here is a heavy sign of flirting here. I always figured people were just getting rid of extra drugs haha.

I was at the front left near the speakers. Saw some friends. Brought some weed to smoke from the shop downstairs. They're usually the ones with weed so it felt nice to offer some instead for once.

Just as I'm twisting off the end of the joint and lighting it, some random woman says hi and asks if she could get a hit. In my head I was like "this is very rude, I don't think I know them. If I pass this joint straight to her before my friends my friends will think I care more about some random stranger more than them. I donâ€™t want to disrespect the people I'm dancing with". So it was a hard pass for me. I told her (like an asshole) that she was welcome to smoke, but I'm passing it to my friends first. Sounds like a complete dick move, but, but, BUT it's not about the weed. Just basic drugging principles?

Maybe I was being an asshole, maybe the weed thing to do is to just share unconditionally. I agree with that philosophy when it involves people I know - even as acquaintances. But not so much with random ravers - especially before I even light it up. I hope she got high, because I went back to dancing after passing the joint.

Music was pure litt. It actually seemed like Cera Khin was just playing whatever she wanted but also as if she was carefully planning every track and transition for the crowd. It seemed like she was carefully watching every single raver and matching the energy perfectly. I don't think I've ever seen another DJ completely control the audience with a mixer like her.

Here's a high recollection that may or may not be accurate: I remember stopping for a cigarette break just as it seemed like there was going to be a drop in the music. As I went to light my cigarette I heard the bass get cut off for a millisecond. And when I looked up to her mixing I think I saw her wave a finger as if to say no cigarette break for you.

It needs to be mentioned again, that I was super high, and that it could've just been my ego imagining things".

At some point in the night someone messaged me where to party.

I should've asked or figured out what kind of people they were with and should've just ignored the message or sent them elsewhere.

In comes 5 crackheads. 2 of them were relatively chill, but not the type of people I'd ever trust with money or drugs. I'll eat a taco with them. Maybe.

But I'd never willingly pass a joint to most of them. In my high state of mind I was totally disappointed when I saw them. They kept extending their hands for a handshake or fist bump because that's all what some people care about when they first enter a party. Find some people they know. Say hi. Show association. Aquire clout.

I didn't want to be associated with a few of them so in order to protect my precious high, I decided that I was going to party solo from that point on. The people I was actually friends with were cool enough to just let me do my own thing away from them. The uncool people kept trying to interact with me. FFS I was visibly ignoring them and they wouldn't get the hint. Totally bad vibes. I didn't let it bother me too much, I found my corner at the very front and just raved till the end except for when I went to get a drink. Unfortunately as soon as I got a drink, she stopped playing (before I could even enjoy the drink back at my previous rave corner. Kind of glad the set ended that way however.

Ended on a high. Total fan for life.

Next DJ cleared the floor. Homie played some dumb shit ngl. Not techno at all. As an empath I tried to stay awhile to give him a chance. It was pretty impressive how quickly people left to go to the party downstairs.

I have a list of the worst DJs Iâ€™ve ever heard (myself included ofc) for events that need help clearing people out at the end of the night. Instead of having staff members slowly push people out of venues at the end, they should just book professionally shit DJs for the closing closing act. Even for just 5 mins. So sad. ðŸ˜­

I went to this event because of Cera Khin's bio description about playing whatever the fuck she wants to play. I didn't need to check her SoundCloud or anything. I was sold. Final detail: she was wearing a plain white shirt. No visible logos. Totally techno.
