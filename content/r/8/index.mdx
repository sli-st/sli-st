Chipsy sent me a DM with this flyer. One of the flyer/videos said "Just Techno" and when I saw a few of the names on the flyer, I knew it meant just techno. After a few disappointing events from the previous weekends, I thought the flyer was almost a joke meant for me. Spoiler, it was good hard techno. Unfortunately I got there late. Got there in time for K1lltheelite's and Chipsy Riot's sets. Music was hard techno. I forget what I was on, but I saw a lot of familiar faces. I somehow knew every single person on the flyer due to a past after. Great people behind and in front of the decks... and they like dark techno. Literally some of the friendliest people I've met in CDMX. I liked the set design. There was a screen or mesh cage or something similar. It made the music itself take center stage. However, in center, was princex human in full rave gear, hosting the party. The concept of hosts and hostesses in techno parties is new to me. She's definitely one of the better ones- or at least scary?? I didn't know who she was or even that she was the same person mentioned on the flyer. She had cool psychedelic dance movements and seemed to be playing with the people dancing around her. I personally like dancing in the front so at some point she was in my personal dancing space and I was like alright whatever I'm just going to get even closer to the front and take some of that unused dancing space for myself. She obviously had more energy than me so I'm sure at some point I backed off to get a drink. Cool energy on the dance floor. One of the few people who have convinced me of the power of a great host/ess. Overall great first impression of a Just Collective party. Totally a fan now and excited whenever I see their logo on a flyer. I'll have more to say about their other events. I got to this one too late- biggest regret of the night by far.
