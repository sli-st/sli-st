This was my first weekend weekend in CDMX, a couple days after my first rave experience. This was also my first time at Donceles (THE Donceles). So I was at Massiosarre hostel at the time and this random local dude came to hang out on the rooftop because friends of guests were allowed to visit. I don't know whose friend he was, but the previous day he told us about this party and we went there with a group of like 10 people from the hostel. I'll write about it once I find the flyer jaja again. Anyways he was talking big talk about knowing the whole CDMX party scene because he used to be a photographer?? I was trying to hype everyone up to get ready to party again, but it seemed like everyone was too tired from the previous night, so when it hit midnight I was the only person willing to go, but since this was still my first week I was a bit unfamiliar and asked if he still wanted to party. He said hhe couldn't find one and I was like here's the flyer I was showing everyone earlier (that he said wasn't a good idea lmao). For the record I'm totally arrogant (NOW!) about my ability to find the best dark techno parties every single weekend but at the time I was merely sheep. So we end up going there. We went to the party on the first floor but there was somemthing going on upstairs as well. Downstairs was cheaper and he didn't want to spend much money. The flyer was actually for the party upstairs but the first floor was interesting as well. At some point he took out some weed but he didn't have paper. I asked the bartended for some paper, I rolled, we smoked and then he passed out on one of the cushiony chairs. Before he passed out he told me his phone was dead and to let him know when I'd leave. I was a bit drunk and high and also bored of the music so I went to explore upstairs. Music was tier 1 litt. I went in and 15 mins later I went down to check up on him but he wasn't there... dude should have asked one of the staff for a charger- it's Donceles- they generally care about their guests especially when it comes to something as basic as charging a phone. Anyways, the dude who was supposed to be the connect left and I was left to party on my own. I go upstairs and at this point Chipsy was playing. Dude was playing hard techno. I don't remember much about exactly what kind of techno, but after his set ended I was just walking around looking for a lighter and I saw him smoking, so I asked if I could borrow his light and told him that he was playing great music, he said something in Spanish, I was like no se espanol lo siento, and he was like where you from mate, blah blah small talk. Then I went back to the dancefloor. Dancefloor was very well set up. Minimal lights, red, and big big speakers. Alan Broudy was playing. Dude was playing on the most basic mixing equipment (400 I think), but it was connected to some really big speakers. I liked the statement - sound is priority. I was super high and super dying from lack of sleep. I was borderline hallucinating. The music was very intense, I took a selfie video telling my friends where I thought I was and that I might die because my heart was beating too fast. I really don't know. The music was hard and psychedelic but not like acid or high bpm. This dude was just cranking the speakers right at the edge before shitty distortion. It was very artistic. There were only about 15 people max and a few people in particular really enjoying the music and dancing in the weirdest groovyiest way to the music (Patricia and Manuel- great people who love dark nasty techno and have helped me out many times with after parties and just plain taking care of me when I've been at my druggiest. At some point the party ended and I was outside. I was feeling like a tourist so I started just going up to people asking for an after kind of like "hola hoy soy touristo yo buscando para un after" and people were like "same same". I saw Chipsy exit the building and I was like "hey is there another party or something" and he pointed at Patricia, Manuel, Gledd and his GF whose name I can't recall at the moment. And he also added me to this private whhatsapp group for parties. He said he had to go to sleep but that they'd be able to help me out - I don't remember if he spoke to them before leaving (I think he did tho...), but a few moments later Patrcia motioned me to come join them with a thumbs up or that thing peopleh here do with their index fingers. So yeah I joined them to go to this dude's after party (Steven's). Names are all relevant because they will appear again in future reflections. Donceles 2nd floor party was amazing that night. My first two raves in CDMX weren't the hardest techno events and I was losing a bit of hope and almost planning on leaving for GDL, but this party by itself and the after party culture made me reconsider my plans and stay for another week which turned to months. The after party was a super drag party and totally not a scene that I was familiar with. I saw more ass than I was prepared for lol. People were kind, I brought some Bailey's with me as a party favor. Steven was delighted, made me feel welcome, asked me if I wanted anything and I was like "coffee by any chance?" It was 7am in the morning and I'm sure the dude was probably a bit tired from his own night out, but he made me some coffee which I mixed with the Bailey's. I asked if I could pass out and he was like sure dude feel free. I decided against it since I still didn't really know anyone there and also because my hostel was about 10 minutes away. I didn't expect to see them again at the time and I'm sure they didn't expect to see me ever again, but over the past several months I've run into them many times. Great introduction to Mexican hospitality, Mexican raunchy angsty techno, Donceles, and a lot of the regulars of the undergroud who have been consistently helping me navigate the underground scene. Fun fact- apparently Chipsy's USB wasn't working and he had to improvise with someone else's USB. Dude was playing hard techno no problem with possibily unfamiliar music. It was a while before I got to hear him play hard techno again since he has a rep for playing just about everything instead of a specific genre(s). I later met some of his other friends in the same collective as him (Just Us) on a seperate occasion and was totally surprised to learn they were all friends but at the same time not really. Good intro to the underground. More confidence in my personal ability to find better parties than a local who was supposed to be my connect. Hooked.
