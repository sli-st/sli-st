This was the basement that was just known as the basement for many ravers in the niche dark techno scene of mid-late 2021. This was also where I was first introduced to the underground COVID rave scene.

Probably helped mold my current techno preferences.

This was the ravers safe haven from the virus - the lack of ventilation and smoke in the air probably killed any virus or biological anything in the air.

This was a Taken party. Drugging freedom, decent drinks, good vibes, music appreciation everywhere.

Dude played for like more than 6 hours. I got there at 10pmish and left at like 10am. Some events in this location were shutdown by the police before, but somehow this weekend event just kept going.

Drinks were fine. You could sneak stuff in. Drugs were around. No disco balls. It was still going on until atleast noon. It got packed. Sonico played some really hard high bpm industrial techno. More hard than acid if anything. At some point Sonico went to the restroom and just left a track playing.

People were still dancing as if he was still right there. I was like "damn dude your music is so good you don't even need to be here." And he was like "word".

Set design was techno- simple and minimal with a cage in front of the DJ booth to protect the equipment from attention-starved idiots like me who need to be in the front - near the speakers.

We had a nice cameo appearance from local techno DJ Like Mee - who was playing in some non-techno venue in New Jersey. I was living in New Jersey at the time, but partying with people from NJ is probably miserable so I went to NYC instead (very close and convenient). Anyways he made a surprise appearance later in the night and played some b2b.

Super humble people, good taste in music. Both were ready again for the outdoor party the following evening in Brooklyn between the two bridges.

Asked Sonico the next day about his type of music because I was starting to get lost in all the electronic sub-genres.

We exchanged names, he told me to add him on IG. He didn't add me back. Hard techno.
