Cali to NYC collab hyppeee type stuff by the local organizers who were also DJs. Understandable as Lindsey is well renowned. The venue came to be known as the Lindsey Herbert place for the next few events that were held there by a couple other techno collectives. It was a photostudio so a lot of open space. Local DJ friends SoundPilot and Auphoria were also playing b2b there before the main event. I didn't think too much of acid tech at the time because I just thought of it as squeaky metal noises but I knew the best event of the night was probably going to be there. I can now appreciate acid techno thanks to Lindsey. She played industrial acid. Sometimes a bit dark, sometimes a bit happy playful. Literally a two-tone baddie. My friends were asking where I was partying that night, I told them to go to another party because I knew some of the partygoers were raudy animals that were only in these parties because of some random connection. Not the best members of society. And certainly people I would never want to smoke or hang with. Trash. The party I suggested got cancelled but happened to be nearby and my friend ended up finding the party I was at along with several others I knew. I had to spend the entire fucking time there getting a few drunk assholes to leave my friends alone (because my friends were asking me to). Like damn homies, this shouldn't be my problem, I'm here to get drunk and do drugs, tell them to fuck off- be rude if you need to. At some point I just got tired and said something along the lines of I'm going to go dance in the front and to just join me, since as any experienced raver knows, the creepers usually stay in the sidelines to look for victims to accidentally bump against. Highlight was when one of the POS tried to hang with Dianita, queen bee of nyc event promoters TechnoGirlsNYC, and her cool 2coke crew. She gave him the nastiest look and was like "que quieres perrito." It was a dirty low blow insult, but I liked it... So yeah me and my techno friend just raved in the front in the space between the speakers in front of Lindsey. She was totally animated while DJing and engaging with the audience with her fast? mixing. At some point my friend left with the rest of the group she came with (also close friends but like on the older side- they put me on babysitting duty while they were there). One of them literally pulled me aside and was like this is your problem now. In any case I had a slightly better time after they left, drank some more, got some sympathy from previously mentioned DJ friends who were of the same opinion that it sucks to mix underground social circles with normal people because some people in raves are animals that use drugs as an excuse for acting like pieces of shit. I got high. 2C, coke, and weed. When the party ended DJ friends asked me to take a group photo of them with Lindsey. Phone was a bit old for dark photography- I should of offerred mine, but I had been watching youtube videos on how to shoot with a cellphone and I'm real techno when it comes to taking photos of people and like angles and two-thirds rules and whatever so I took a pretty good techno pic of them. It's red you can find it in their tagged section on IG. She was cool, she was talking about how she doesn't like to play B2B with most people because of her style. Made perfect sense with how dynamic her mixing was. Lindsey played great music. She was definitely passionate about what she was sharing.Changed my view on acid and was the perfect introduction to the genre as it set the bar high. And you could tell she was a real real raver. 3 hour extended set past the original schedule. After her set she pulled out a banana. Very experienced-raver behavior. I started bringing trail mix with me sometimes for future parties. Very techno. Her face showed real emotion while playing. Just very lively. Less intimidating as a person than her tattoos might suggest, but her techno is definitely on the hard industrial side. My mouth was dry and I didn't feel like socializing with all the drugs in me. I said I enjoyed her music and left. I'm sure I'll see her play again someday.
