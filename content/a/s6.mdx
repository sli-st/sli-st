Rave Tips | Rave Tips & Tricks | Rave TTS is a collection of tips and tricks for raving. It's the tits.

## Why?

I'm an egotistical frequent raver who thinks they know how to rave better than the average asshole on the dancefloor.

This is also another creative outlet.

A few months ago I used to post rave stories and tips (very unstructured) on instagram. They were mostly random post-after recovery musings. They usually got a lot of good responses. Sometime in November, someone approached me in-person to confirm if I was SLi.ST just so they could compliment me on a rave tip from the first couple months of the project. That was very touching as this project is still mostly anonymous.

Similar to the "Rave Reflections" project, the content is all original. It's meant to inspire some sharing. I want more people to discover the instagram flyer sharing project, the website, and all the other content. The reflections are probably better for social media sharing, whereas this is likely better for search engine discoverability. "Rave Tips and Tricks" sounds pretty easy to market and optimize.

## Goals:

- 1000 tips
- increase overall viewership
- increase social media followership
- save atleast 1 raver from a bad trip/after
