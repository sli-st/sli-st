"SLi.ST" is a play on the word "guestlist". It's also a different type of guestlist- something a bit more permanent.
It's a list of people that really trusts this project for its ability to get them good offers and find them great events. The offers range from random discounts to free entry. The requirements constantly change, but once you're on the list you stay on.

## Theory

- ravers like to feel special and taken care of - like most normal people
- event organizers benefit from simply having certain people at their events
- the list of members should attract special offers
- the special offers should attract signups
- if you're willing to join the list then you probably trust the project to find you quality events
- events can get special attention for their events by giving special attention to the members list
- the signup process selects for banger ravers who bring good energy to the dancefloor

## How it works

- you can confirm membership at the door by displaying your @social_media at the door

## Listing Policy

- I will not moderate the list
- once you're on the list, you're on it for good
- I will adjust the signup process in order to keep the list as attractive as possible
- there are no tiers or hierarchy within the list
- membership does not expire
- the list is sorted alphabetically
