title: "Rave Reflections"

A series of reflections on past events I've attended.
Each of them are memorable events that I've generally enjoyed.
Completely unsolicited.

## Copied from the IG anouncement post:

Today I’m sharing a “new” project I’ve been working on for the past few weeks. There isn’t really a name for it, but we could call it something of a "public journal", or “adventure reflections”, or maybe “rave reflections”. Regardless, these are not reviews. When I go to most events, I usually\* don’t take my phone out to record anything. So, in order to remember some of my favorite rave experiences, I've been writing about them instead. Before I wrote the first reflection and before I figured out how I’d structure these pieces, I met a fellow raver who knew about the original @slistcdmx account. She approached me at a party to confirm a lead that I was behind S List. She told me she liked some of the stuff I used to write such as my rave tips and rave stories. I wrote almost all of that stuff while under the influence, or while I was recovering so I’m very glad she shared her opinions. At the time I knew I wanted to explore a journaling project, but I didn’t know how I’d structure my writing, what kind of tone to use (casual vs serious), or what to even focus on in my writings. Later that night we met up at an after and she told told me about her own magazine article regarding the underground rave scene. And then later that morning I read her article for inspiration. I was super high on MDMA and most likely speed so I didn't feel like sleeping that morning. Instead I decided to take a shot at writing a couple pieces since I had so much energy. I decided to just free write them at first. And then I realized that I liked the free written "format" as it was- unstructured and unedited. I didn't want to censor myself and I didn't want there to be a specific structure to each piece. It felt more natural to just write whatever came to my mind, go on tangents, and focus on whatever I thought was important to each of my experiences. Every event is memorable for different reasons. I also liked my frantic style of writing - probably due to the drugs I was on. The first title of this project was actually going to be "Speed List" (a play on S List) because I was speed writing while I was ( most likely) on speed. Everything is mostly unedited and free written. Enjoy!!! 🙂🙃🙂
