I currently use my stories to share most upcoming events. I then sort each story/flyer by date and into highlights. The highlights are labeled with the dates they represent. I keep a seperate highlight labeled "S List" as my
personal S List of events. It's for the events that I'm personally looking forward to - usually dark techno, experimental, and/or unique art events.

This is personally useful for me as a way of saving the events I want to go to. Some people also
like to know which events I think are going to be the best events for my
personal tastes (probably because we share similar tastes).
