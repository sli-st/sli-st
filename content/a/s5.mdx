title: "DJ Name"

Sometime in September I saw a post from "El Real Under" about their open deck
events on Thursdays. I sent them a DM with a description of what I
liked to play and they invited me over and asked for my DJ name.

Somehow I had never decided on a name before that point despite
practicing for many hours on end. I figured "S List" already had
some branding behind it, that some of my closest friends knew
that I was behind the project, and that it was easy enough to
pronounce. So I went with "S List" for my first ever flyer. Towards
the end of September, I was invited to open for 49 Basan's B Space project.

It was my first official non-open-deck gig (they put my face on a
flyer official). When they asked for my DJ name I almost started coming up with new names. This was a few weeks within the launch of the website. I wanted to adopt the "." in the domain name in all S List branding, including my DJ name.

I figured if anyone ever googles my name they will at the very least find the website even if my social media goes down.
Yes, I had/have severe PTS from my accounts getting taken down.

The SLi.ST spelling comes from the domain name itself- "sli.st". The capitalization choices come from the "symmetry" between the "i" and period.
