## Philosophy:

- ravers (like me) prefer more options/flyers to plan our nightlife
- event organizers want more people to see their flyers
- both are happier when there are fewer barriers to finding and sharing flyers

## Goals:

- become the go to source for underground events in CDMX and NYC
- find and share more flyers than anyone else :)

## Sharing Policy:

- all flyers are accepted for resharing
- if I see it on my feed or DMs I'll reshare it
- sharing is completely free in the spirit of sharing the underground
  scene

## History:

I wanted to have a seperate instagram just for finding underground events in CDMX. I didn't like seeing flyers from different locations on my main. Registered @slistcdmx (S tier List of events in CDMX) It was a play on the words guestlist and playlist.

"I can't get on the guestlist? I'll create my own slist with blackjack and hookers."

I befriended hip locals and realized I was better and faster at finding flyers than they were. That made me realize there were tons of people who might appreciate my help finding. Before this point I was simply scrolling through my feed and screenshotting flyers that were interesting. However, after that realization I started uploading my screenshots for other people as well.

In order to increase the reach of my account I started tagging the flyers and posting stories. Someone in the comments called me out asking if I was "just posting screenshots". I kind of was. I changed my workflow since then, but for a while it was just a ton of temporary messy looking posts on my profile.

The first account grew to a humble 800+ followers. Nothing too crazy, but it grew pretty quick. And then I downloaded an analytics app and my account got banned. No customer support. I even spent some money on ADs even though they hardly made a difference. The next few accounts quickly got banned as well but only because I was tagging too many people too quickly in stories. Apparently I was as fast as a bot. After the 4 or 5th account got taken
down, I started working on a website that would simply direct people to the current "@slist----" I was using.

Luckily for me there was enough brand recognition from the first account that people were following me back on those accounts before I could even started sharing flyers again. That felt lovely.

For about a month, I stopped sharing flyers while I worked on the website. Angry at Instagram, I decided I would just share the
flyers on the website and promote the website instead. I was getting a bunch of views (a couple thousand/month mostly from return users). I figured there was potential for even greater reach
with people who weren't using instagram for finding events - (tourists, people
searching on google, etc.). I suppose people were also just sharing the link or going directly to the website. I decided to make the website and use social media
primarily for sharing the website instead of sharing everything on Instagram.
This was to avoid getting flagged by Instagram's automatic spam detectors which
are not the best.
