#About
"SLi.ST" is my ongoing effort to carve out a space within the underground rave scene. It's the name of a flyer sharing project, a "guest list" program, a curated list of upcoming events, a list of previous rave experiences, a compilation of rave tips, and recently, my DJ name. They're all essentially lists which kind of explains the name.

The name started as "S List CDMX" on Instagram. After a bunch of my accounts were deactivated, I decided to made a website as something that would be more reliable. I bought a .st domain because I thought it would be clever and give me shorter URLs. I decided to use the lowercase "i" and "." in sli.st in all
