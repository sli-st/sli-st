                <p class="lead">S List began as a finsta for following the underground music scene in CDMX. When I realized some of my friends could 
                    use some help with their nightlife, I spread the word. I remained anonymous as a personal challenge, for a long-term gag,
                    and due to practical reasons.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">I enjoy the anonymity. It lets me be more expressive.

                <p class="lead">There's two S Lists. The one described above, and another list for the events I'm personally looking forward to (pulic). 
                    I currently enjoy raunchy provacative dark techno, some "experimental", and "unique" events.</p>
