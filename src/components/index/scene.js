                In a city of 8+ million, you can find just about every music
                scene in the worold. Every week I find at least 40 underground*
                events in CDMX. Instead of describing every single music
                collective I've listened to and every venue I've been to, it
                might be better if I describe a typical week.

                <b>Mondays and Tuesdays</b> are relatively dead. Every now and
                then a bar will invite a few DJs for a special night.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Monday to Thursdays</b> are usually when the alternative
                events shine. Gothic rock, post punk, metal, country, EMB, synth
                pop and more. There's some really cool stuff you'd almost never
                hear at any of the weekend venues.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Wednesdays</b> get a bit more mainstream with more tech house
                events. Almost never any real techno. There's a few weekend
                venues that have adopted being open on Wednesdays as part of
                their identity.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Thursdays</b> are usually for disco if I go out. The crowds
                are more casual so most venues like to book mainstream sets.
                Think disco, house, and tech house. Pretty much never any hard
                techno- which is what I really prefer. Even if they book a DJ
                that's known for hard techno, the music is always toned down...
                to make it more "palatable"... I wish it were different.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since I like to reserve the real weekend for techno, I don't
                mind starting the "weekend" with a bit of disco (pop, nu, or
                dark preferably). It's usually disco house tho. Even the disco
                gets watered down to disco house most of the time. It's
                Thursday.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disco scene in general, and especially the Thursday disco
                scene, is heavily dominated by the non-binary community. I don't
                know why. As someone who is very binary, I always feel very
                welcome and comfortable however. I point that out for some of my
                fellow ravers who have concerns aout violating safe spaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't like disco as much as I used to. I usually only go out
                on Thursdays if my friends invite me. Many of my friends only
                like disco and house, so it's one of the few times I can go
                party with them. When I'm not socializing with them, I'm on the
                dancefloor learning disco moves from the more passionate dancers
                around me. Techno came from disco peeps. There is much to learn
                about rhythm from discoheads.
              </p>
              <p>
                If I have to go disco I usually prefer two nightclubs in
                Cuauhtémoc- the one with free entry and the other with
                Funktion-One sound systems. If you know you know.

                <b>Fridays</b> are the best for my music tastes atm. I like
                techno. Specifically dark techno. Think bass heavy. High BPM,
                sick-nasty-scary-angry-crunchy-NASTY-NASTY-techno. The stuff
                that gets people riled up, wide-eyed, and ON EDGE. The kind that
                turns any respectable looking establishment into a sweaty
                pheromone-rank demon hole. So dark it makes me feel vibrant,
                cathartic, and empty. So I can appreciate life again. That
                dahhrk dark. No disco balls in sight.
              </p>
              <p>
                I like it mental and psychedelic. The crowds are usually filled
                with real techno enthusiasts who are there for the music and
                maybe a bit more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I save my body for Friday night techno. Sometimes I rave
                completely sober for a more "pure" experience. More often,
                however, I take a carefully overdosed cocktail of psychedelics.
                I wait 'til I start gritting my teeth ;) put my wallet and phone
                in my front pockets, stop socializing, and jump straight into
                the thick of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                No matter where I am on the dance floor, it’s me and the DJ.
                Every now and then I’ll find myself turning my head just to see
                if anyone else is in the same plane of existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                I usually end my Friday nights at someone’s after-after-party
                Saturday morning/noon.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Saturdays</b> are usually also my techno nights, but since
                the biggest hyped up events are typically on Fridays, and
                because many people are still recovering, there's a slight drop
                in energy. There are more day events however. If I’ve had my
                fill of techno on Friday, I’ll usually opt for something
                experimental. Maybe a late night art gallery, or rooftop tech
                house with tacos, or maybe just more techno. Pretty much never
                ever any disco or house since that can be found on most other
                days of the week. I have a feeling reggaeton might be the move,
                but so far I haven’t really enjoyed myself at those events.
              </p>
              <p>
                I like to end my raving after Saturday night, but sometimes I’ll
                also after-party-party until Monday morning.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Sundays</b> are chill. It's the unofficial tech house and
                disco night. There’s usually higher profile disco DJs playing on
                Sundays and most events start earlier and end earlier. There are
                always a bunch of rooftop events for people who just want to
                chill, eat, and relax. Not really my vibe, but hanging out with
                friends, eating food and actually having conversations isn’t
                half-bad.
