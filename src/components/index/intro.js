            <p>9/15 update: Happy Independence day! Pervert mx and the donceles 88 after party are my recommendations tonight. This is the new home. Social media will only be used to promote this website and for sharing events very infrequently. Might be bringing on new team members. Original mission and vision will not change. All events are for sharing. We will be getting more commercial with cortesias for the community and merch that will work as discounts at the door. More freedom than ever. Bookmark this site. Daily updates soon. Videos soon. Pictures soon. Amazing collaborations soon.
