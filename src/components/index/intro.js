            <p>11:07am update. no more resharing via social media for me. feel free to send leads via DMs and email at whatever IG account the link above is pointing to. im figuring out a more sustainable, reliable way for me to share events on a daily basis without ever losing access to the community again. big fat changes. polls coming soon- but this time irl. #can'tdeactivateacommunity too fried to do this right now. but automated systems coming very soon. i will provide people more reasons to visit sli.st for events than their IG feed. for me as well. i like a gallery instead of swiping through stories. it was easier for me to just look through my screenshots on the photos app. gimme a min pls also some style bugs are being fixed. es translation, and nyc page coming up soon as well since my visa is gonna run out soon and im going to need to stay updated for that as well. if i ever leave cdmx, this project will continue with or without me, but with me. <br /> slist thoughts before i pass out... for thinking and chilling during the day: tepetex., weird music but new is new, 100% encourages new thoughts, good food too. new sunday spot maybe? hard techno: trasfondo because of their last event 2 weeks ago with a very similar lineup. miss nasty killed it. elliot roight it ack to life and then killed it again. this time she's closing. call me an ambulamb to the hospital cuz thats where the after is going to be. no binariomx for the good drinks like their events at 49 basan. curated atmosphere that is usually a springboard for some (encouraged by them!) more for socializing and dancing with a drink in your hand. heard chipsy play some hard techno at basan and he went harder than many techno djs at more techno venues so i really don't know enough, i would normally go there and then ask around where to go after because thats where the cool people went secret secret s list jk lol ;|, now i kind of just find everything when my social medias are working as they should. </p>
