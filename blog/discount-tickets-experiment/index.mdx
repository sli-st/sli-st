I want to negotiate bulk-like discounts for my base. If someone sees a discount posted on this website, I want them to feel assured that they don't need to look around for a better offer. I want to be their last stop before making a purchase. Anything short of that diminishes my credibility.

## Why?

I want to give people more reasons to continue supporting me. There are people who enjoy and trust my curation so I'd like to build on that and offer more value.

## Goals:

- offer the best discounts
- become the authority for the cheapest tickets to the best raves
