This dude kinda looks like the grim reaper even without his mask. All black type. I showed up early because I had a lot of free time and no friends. And also because a Taken friend publically anounced all future Taken events are free for me. So I went early to see if he was there. Helped move some furniture and smoked some weed with the peeps. Warmup was good, but nothing could have prepared us for the main event. This was at the Lindsey spot, Taken Style- the mixing table was at the center of the dancefloor. They lit up red candles around the table and as the music got more intense they turned up the fog machine. I took some acid from the local drug dealing dj - it's very safe to trust drug dealing artists. Anyways, I was transported. Hard style. Music was very very intense and high bpm. It was hard to see who was dancing next to me most of the time so it felt like it was just me and the music. The techno had an angsty element to it and at some point I just wanted to grab my special techno friend and just punch her. A wall wouldn't have worked- needed something mushy. It was some real cathartic stuff. I didn't punch her (she wanted to punch me too btw - IDK we like dark nasty techno). Vendex's masks are a work of art. They express different emotions depending on angles. They can seem to express demonic laughter and also painful crying. After his set ended someone else took over. I figured the event was going to end soon so I went outside for some fresh air and a ciggy break. I saw Vendex chilling outside and I was like "nasty stuff dude, why so dark, why the mask"- the same stuff he probaly hears after most events. And he said something along the lines of "I want my audiences to feel all the artificial negativity that I can transmit and then let those feelings get expunged so that they can feel cathartic". And then he said he was going to play another set so we went inside. Very friendly. Likes high bpm. Produces a lot. Real performance DJ who seems to truly believe in his craft and mission. Very inspiring goal. Mask kind of weeb, but also real art. Everyone else who wears a mask like some clown wishes they had half the effect this dude has on his audiences. This was supposed to be my last party in NYC before MY CDMX trip. The Taken dudes know I love dark techno and told me about the event weeks in advance before it was pulic when I told them I was leaving for CDMX in the first week of June. I may have left sooner if they hadn't told me earlier. Unfortunately there seemed to be a couple other events coming up so I postponed my trip by a week and also not as cathartically as I would have liked. Vendex is a true practicioner of the dark arts.
